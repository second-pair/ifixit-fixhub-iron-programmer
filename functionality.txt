Based off what the Web Interface provides and what's additionally available from the Serial interface, here's what I'm intending on implementing in the first instance:


-=>  Base Functionality
Serial Port selector, maybe implementing memory of the last device you connected to.

-=>  Core Readouts
Switch Status [heater details]
Curr Temp, Curr Power / Duty Cycle % [heater details / heater controlloop]
Status/State [heater details]

-=>  Secondary Readouts
Tip Installed [heater details]
Serial Number [otp read], MCU S/N [mcu_sn], Version [otp read, version]
Uptime [uptime]
Fault Mask [heater faultmask]
Accelerometer [mxc4005 magnitude]

-=>  Setpoints
SP Temp [settings activetemp]
SP Min Temp [seems to be fixed at 200], SP Max Temp [settings maxtemp]

-=>  Configuration
Celsius/Farenheit [settings units]
Idle Enable [settings idletimerenable], Idle Timer [settings idletimer], Idle Temp [settings idletemp]
Sleep Enable [settings sleeptimerenable], Sleep Timer [settings sleeptimer]
Temperature Correction [settings tempcorrection]
Reboot [bootloader reboot / reset]
Reset

-=>  Advanced
PID Kp, Ki, Kd, Max i
Control loop period uS


In due course, I might be able to offer firmware upgrade capabilities, but no promises for now!
